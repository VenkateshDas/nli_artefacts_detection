# Detection, Evaluation and Mitigation of Language Artefacts in the Competition On Legal Information Extraction and Entailment Dataset

## This REPO is still WIP. The scripts are not yet finalized.

This repository consists of the codebase for the thesis work on detecting, evaluating and mitigating the language/dataset artefacts in the legal information entailment dataset.

The codebase is categorized into separate folders containing Python notebooks for conducting the experiments.

data —> This folder is a placeholder to place the datasets needed for analysis

src/data scripts —> This folder contains scripts needed for data analysis and data preprocessing.

src/detection —> This folder contains the scripts needed for artefact detection in the dataset.

src/evaluation —> This folder contains the scripts needed for evaluating the BERT-based models for robustness.

src/mitigation —> This folder contains the necessary scripts for data augmentation to mitigate the contradiction word and word overlap artefacts.
